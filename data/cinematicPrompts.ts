    "prompt_cinematografico": "A solitary figure stands motionless in the center of a massive, abandoned industrial warehouse, wide shot, low angle, 24mm lens. The scene is illuminated by dramatic Volumetric Lighting (God Rays): several powerful shafts of light stream down from high, dirty industrial windows, cutting through the exceptionally thick Atmospheric Haze (dust and smoke). This creates a stark Chiaroscuro effect, where the figure is dramatically silhouetted against the bright beams and surrounded by deep, mysterious shadows. The color temperature is a muted, cold industrial blue. 4K cinematic quality, gritty dystopian aesthetic, grand and desolate atmosphere."

    "prompt_cinematografico": "Medium close-up shot of a defeated scientist standing amidst the smoldering ruins of their lifelong creation, the camera uses a rapid Dolly Zoom (Efecto Vértigo) movement on their face to emphasize their profound psychological despair and failure, the shot then lingers on their broken figure. The light is overwhelmingly dramatic: dense smoke and dust create intense Volumetric Lighting (God Rays) that cut through the scene, starkly silhouetting the scientist. The color palette is defined by a cool blue in the shadows contrasted with the warm, menacing orange glow of the embers. Low angle shot, 4K cinematic quality, tragic blockbuster style, overwhelming and final atmosphere."

The camera executes a slow, chilling Dolly Zoom (Efecto Vértigo) movement, centered on the hanging cube to emphasize psychological dread. The scene is lit by harsh, directional Chiaroscuro lighting, casting sharp, geometric shadows that stretch and distort the figure's silhouette.
